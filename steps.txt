1. data preprocessing

- Download some test data first - save it offline in csv to test and build the model

- The data should be saved such that the web preprocessing and python preprocessing mathces
and gives same result for same data.

- Download the data directly using firebase connection, save the data

- preprocess the data and then save to numpy or any format

2. build the model

- Decide the features that go into the model

- Build an entry level lstm model and train it using the data

3. setup update of the model based on latest data

--> next steps
